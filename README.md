# School_District_Analysis
Re-analyzing PyCity School District data after removing scores due to suspicion of academic dishonesty.

## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to examine how removing the 9th graders from Thompson High School changed the outputs. We would expect that the outputs for Thompson High School (and any categories containing Thompson High School) would be lower after the removal of the 9th graders because academic dishonesty is suspected. Most likely, they cheated to make their scores higher, which would inflate the scores in the original analysis. However, it is possible that academic dishonesty occurred that would not have necessarily increased scores for 9th graders (e.g. swapping tests, pulling the fire alarm, or using an outdated answer key). We will discover how the removal of these cases affects the overall results.
